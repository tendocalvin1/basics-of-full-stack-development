## 7 day challenge to understand the very basics of HTML and CSS
## The reason for this is so that I can build scalable applications and become a better software engineer in the era of AI


<!-- 📘 DAY 1 — HTML BASICS (THE SKELETON)
Learn

What HTML is (structure, NOT design)

Tags, elements, attributes

Headings (h1–h6)

Paragraphs, links, images

Practice

Create a personal profile page

Name

Short bio

Link to a social account

Profile image

Challenge (DO NOT SKIP)

Use only HTML

No CSS

Make it readable and well-structured

👉 If your HTML looks like a Word document, you’re doing it right.

📘 DAY 2 — SEMANTIC HTML (STOP USING DIVS EVERYWHERE)
Learn

Semantic tags:

<header>

<nav>

<main>

<section>

<article>

<footer>

Why semantics matter (accessibility, SEO)

Practice

Refactor Day 1 page using semantic tags

Challenge

Create a simple blog page:

Header with site title

Main content with 2 articles

Footer with copyright

⚠️ If you still abuse <div>, fix your mindset now.

📘 DAY 3 — CSS BASICS (MAKE IT NOT UGLY)
Learn

CSS syntax

Selectors

Colors

Fonts

Text styling

class vs id (important!)

Practice

Style your blog:

Change font

Add background color

Improve readability

Challenge

Make your page readable without using images

Focus on spacing and typography

If your CSS is random, you don’t understand it.

📘 DAY 4 — BOX MODEL (THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD CONCEPT)
Learn

margin

padding

border

width / height

box-sizing

Practice

Add spacing properly to your blog

Use DevTools to inspect box sizes

Learn

display: flex

justify-content

align-items

flex-direction

gap

Learn

display: grid

grid-template-columns

gap

Media queries (basic)

Convert your cards into a grid layout

Challenge

Make your layout adjust on small screens

If your site breaks on mobile, it’s unfinished.
